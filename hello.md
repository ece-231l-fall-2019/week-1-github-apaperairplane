# **Bryan Carrillo**
I am a student at UNM. Majoring in computer engineering.
I play the guitar and I live for music and art.
I listen to a lot of metal and rock, and a *bit* of everything else.
## I don't really like to talk about myself so I'll end it with some random information.
* I have never been on a plane.
* My brain is being cooked this year by calculus 2 and physics.
* I am working on my own album (but haven't had time :/ )
* I have a small dog named Maya and I love her.
* I *used* to work with my film friends as an editor and cameraman.
* I am also programming my own text adventure game. In development for 3 years.
That is me in a nutshell.
